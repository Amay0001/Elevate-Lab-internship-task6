**Making Sense of Password Security**
Hey there! This project is all about exploring what makes a password strong and how you can protect yourself online. We tested different kinds of passwords and dug into the common ways hackers try to crack them. The goal? To help you create passwords that keep your accounts safe without making your life harder.

What We Did
Made up passwords with different mixes of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Ran those passwords through strength checkers to see which ones hold up.
Learned tips on what helps a password pass the test and what trips it up.
Looked at popular hacking tricks like brute-force, dictionary attacks, and sneaky stuff like phishing and credential stuffing.
Wrapped it up by explaining why password complexity matters and how to balance strong and easy-to-remember passwords.

What We Learned
Longer passwords are better — think of it like adding more locks on your door.
Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes guesses way harder for hackers.
Passphrases can be a lifesaver — easy for you, tough for others.
Stay away from common words, repeated letters, or sequences like “12345” or “abcdef.”
Don’t just stick numbers or symbols at the end; sprinkle them around for extra strength.
Using the same password everywhere? Big no-no. If one gets hacked, everything does.
Add a second layer of defense with multi-factor authentication whenever you can.


A Quick Look at How Hackers Attack
Here’s a peek at some common ways attackers try to break into your accounts:

Attack Name	What It Means	How to Stay Safe
Brute-force	Trying every combo until they find the right one	Use long, complex passwords and MFA
Dictionary	Testing common passwords and words	Avoid simple/common words
Credential Stuffing	Using leaked passwords on other sites	Use unique passwords everywhere and MFA
Password Spraying	Trying common passwords on many accounts	Strong passwords and account lockout
Phishing	Tricking you into giving your password	Stay alert, check links, use MFA
Rainbow Table	Using pre-made lists to reverse password hashes	Store passwords with salt and strong hashing
Final Thoughts
Think of your password like your home’s front door lock: it needs to be strong enough to keep out unwanted visitors, but you still want to be able to open it without too much fuss. Pick a password (or better yet, a passphrase) that’s long, varied, and unique for each place you need one. And whenever you can, turn on multi-factor authentication — it’s like having a second lock or a security guard. That’s how you stay secure and keep the bad guys out!
